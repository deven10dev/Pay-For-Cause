# Pay for Cause
The Application helps the group to make their organizations raise funds and make their service more efficient by directly advertising their motive to the donor. Organizations with different motives like feed the poor, medical assistance for those affected by Covid-19 and many other motives can raise funds using this platform. 
New growing Startups can also register and raise funds using this portal.

# Motivation
Raising funds is never easy for a growing Organization.
The Organization must advertise its motive and gain trust of the donor, which might be difficult to do if the Organization is new. Without sufficient funding, the organization might find it hard to provide the necessary services.
It is also quite difficult for donor to trust the organizations and make sure that his help is used for the betterment of the society or not.
This can be made easy by registering the Organization on a common and safe fund-raising portal, where a donor can directly get the information of the NGOs, Startups, or any other organizations and then he can decide which organization he should donate. Organizations can also reduce their cost of advertisement.
